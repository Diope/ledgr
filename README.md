A small React/Firebase/Redux app to learn Firebase. I'm not 100% sure if my database rules are correct but so far with testing it's been pretty solid. I received help developing this and I think some rules have been broken that will soon be problematic, more specifically the redux store singleton being called twice.

At this point I'm pretty comfortable with React and some small gaps in knowledge of Redux clicked which will make working on my other projects namely [Drybbble](https://diope.github.com/drybbble) much easier to do.

End goal is to host this somewhere but I still have things I need to work on before I do.
